          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Income, Age and Health Conditions</h2>
          <h6>Use the interactive chart above to view the data represented in the article.</h6>
          <p>When looking at smokers, the data shows that states with a lower median income have a higher percentage of smokers in the population. When compared to the percentage of the population in poverty, it follows that states with more of the population in poverty have a higher percentage of the population that smokes. Median age seems to have no strong correlation to the percentage of the state's population that smokes.</p>
          <p>With obesity rates, lower median income correlates to a higher percentage of obese people in the state. Following this trend, higher poverty rates correlate with higher obesety rates in the states. It appears that a state's median age has no correlation with obesity rates in that state.</p>
          <p>While obesity rates and smoker rates for a state seemed to have some correlation to income, the percentage of the population that lacks healthcare appears to be different. Median age and median income both appear to have no strong correlation to the percentage of a state's population that lack healthcare. The poverty rate of a state, however, shows a positive correlation to the percentage of the population without healthcare, where states with a higher poverty rate also show a higher percentage of the population without healthcare.</p>
